    <p class="job-desc">I’m a wannabe nerd, who enjoys deep-diving geeky topics but never skilled enough to put into practice.
      Learning is my lifelong passion, but I occasionally enjoy golf and being let down by my favorite teams.<br><br>
      On a personal level, I’m a proud big brother to two, Memphian, and now ATLien of eight years.<br><br>
  This website is my experiment to learn front-end development and serve as an artifact of my <a href={{ "/projects" | relative_url }}>work</a>, <a href={{ "/experience" | relative_url }}>experiences</a>, and <a href={{ "/blog" | relative_url }}>general thoughts on life.</a> Let me know what you think – good or bad.<br><br>
